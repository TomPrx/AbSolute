# Bench analyzer

This project is useful to analyze benchmark results collected with `bench_absolute`.
One goal is to compare different solver to point out advantages and weaknesses.
For example, we would like to know which problem's instances AbSolute can solve that GeCode cannot, or if we can improve a known lower bound on some problems.
