(** The octagonalisation consists in explictly representing the variables modelling rotated planes in the octagon.
  Consider the octagonal constraint `X - Y <= 10`, the variables `X` and `Y` can be depicted as a box in the canonical plane of the octagon.
  The idea of octagonalisation is to associate two new variables by considering the plane (X,Y) rotated at 45Â°.
  The different strategies consist in selecting which variables we want to represent explicitly.
  NOTE: the goal is to filter the rotated constraints in the Box abstract domain. *)

(** A single plane (i,j) is generated, such that it maximizes the number of "promising schema" in the constraint.
    A promising schema is an expression in the rotated constraint that can be easily simplified. *)
